![Moxie Jams Out](/imgs/moxie_jams.jpg)

A few months into development of Moxie we had already started bringing on beta testers. This was certainly the right choice and I’m glad we did it earlier then later. The first couple weeks of releases were pretty messy but our group of testers gave good feedback and helped us quickly iterate towards a better product. We also made connections with key people in our space through this beta program. Having these people in early helped us foster relationships that made for a much stronger launch then we would have had otherwise.

This being said, we could have gotten much more out of our beta program. We did not spend time connecting with local artists and photographers. Why is this important? Having a conversation face to face with a customer always trumps having one over email, especially in the early stages of a startup. We missed out on crucial feedback that we needed at the formative stages of our idea. We thought we were getting out of the building, but obviously we missed that entirely. Pushing builds and having email conversations is completely INSIDE the building.

Along with not connecting closely with our early users, we also didn’t qualify the people we did have conversations with. Since we didn’t have a clear understanding of who our ideal customer was, it was impossible to understand and weigh the feedback we were receiving. I tried hard to keep a solid course that made the best sense in my head, but it was really hard to decide with all the competing feedback. Even then it was clear that the feedback was conflicting but I didn’t have a method to sort it out. I also didn’t have the clarity to make the decision which users to build Moxie for. This was the beginning of my inability to see that I was too close to the problem. It also marked the beginning of Moxie’s slow slide into its current stalled state.

Near launch it seemed that I had thrown out almost everything I had learned about customer development. At this point I was just going through the motions to appease my inner entrepreneur who knew things were seriously off course. Because I was too close to the situation and didn’t take time to pull back to a larger view, I wasn’t able to see what has become so glaring now. Moxie tried to become something it had no business or right to be. We tried to make Moxie a competitor to Instagram. No amount of micro niche focus or technology advantage would be able to overcome a social network with over 100 million active users. The people we were building Moxie for would never want to leave a space that had such a large reach to share their photos. By not focusing on our customers’ needs we ended up in the weeds.

Let me restate this so I completly understand it. We were trying to solve a problem with Moxie that Instagram was doing just fine solving for our target customers. In my head I believed I had the idea and execution to beat out Instagram for our slice of the market. All I had to do was ask one person. All I had to do was listen to one customer. These were people I had within my reach throught the beta program, all I had to do was listen to them. I was too close to the situation, too married to my idea, and not open to hearing the truth.

That is why Moxie doesn't excite or connect with the people that we were building it for.

**Biggest take away: do your customer development... dammit!**
