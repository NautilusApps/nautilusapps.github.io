I'm starting a new project in order to push my limits (and show off) as a mobile developer. Hustle is yet another Dribbble client for iOS. I'm going to taking my developer and designer skills to the next level with this project. Having a project like this gives me the chance to try new things without disappointing a client or screwing up an existing code base. When you become entrenched in a long term project its very easy to let your skills stagnate. Building Hustle is my solution.
