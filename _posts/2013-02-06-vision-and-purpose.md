### WHAT DOES YOUR APP STAND FOR, WHAT IS IT REALLY ABOUT?
### WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE?
### WHAT VALUE WILL YOU CREATE FOR PEOPLE?
### WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF YOUR APP?

The process of defining purpose is iterative, but the clearer and stronger your vision and purpose is at the start, the easier the rest of the process will go. Defining the vision of your app is the largest decision you will make and it informs all the smaller decisions. Like any decision in a startup, its subject to change and must be made without too much hesitation. This is the most important step in creating something, but if you never move past this step then a well defined purpose will get you nothing. 

### HOW DO YOU DEFINE THE PURPOSE AND VISION OF YOUR IDEA? 

Develop passion and vision for the problem you are trying to solve. If its not a problem you personally have, get to know someone who does. If it is a problem you deal with then you are lucky. What you need here is a man on the inside. You can only create a clear path to the solution after you grok the underlying problem. Until then your job is to experience and observe. If you or someone on your team doesn't have experience with the problem you are better off finding a new problem to solve.

Once you have that gut level understanding of the problem, you should be able to give your app purpose. If you don't think this is enough to define the vision of your idea then just keep digging into the problem until things become clear.

### THE NEXT STEP

Go make something! In fact, don't wait until you have a perfect understanding of the problem before you start. Quite often its the process of creating a solution that really helps you define the problem. Yes, this part of software development can't be summed up in a list of steps. Sometimes a heuristic is more powerful than a process. This is one of those times.
