Want to learn how Instagram and tons of other apps create those interesting effects with your photos? I'm giving a presentation at the Phoenix iOS Developer Group on Wednesday November 7th. I'm also giving the same presentation (hopefully more polished) at the 2012 Desert Code Camp event.

If you can't make it, here are the slides and source code. Some of this Core Image stuff gets tricky, so I hope this helps build some shared knowledge of Core Image in the iOS community. I owe you all for the knowledge you've shared. Both the code and slides will be a work in progress over the next couple of weeks.
