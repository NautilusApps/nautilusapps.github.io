![Moxie R.I.P.](/imgs/moxie_rip.jpg)

Sometime in February I started the project that eventually became an iOS app named [Moxie](http://moxieapp.co). It feels wrong calling this a postmortem because I haven't made the decision to shutdown the app yet. Instead I'm taking a break for a undetermined length of time to decide what the next steps are. I figured it would be good to break down what has gone right and wrong over the last 10 months with Moxie. I’m doing this more in the hopes that I will learn something then to pass on knowledge.

I also have a more personal reason for writing this blog post. Spending 10 months on a project without achieving traction in the market has considerably shaken my confidence. For the last month I've been trying to be very positive about the whole experience, but I realize now that I need to be honest with myself that Moxie did not go as planned. In a way I've failed to meet the expectations that I've set for Moxie and for myself in this regard. This leaves me wondering how competent of an entrepreneur I really am. Breaking things down to a detailed level will hopefully help me learn where I need to grow my entrepreneurial skills.

Moxie started out as an entirely different app altogether. Originally I was working with another person in the space of photo curation and sharing. This is a problem I still believe isn't solved well. As I dug into formulating a solution and building a business model around it I kept having this nagging feeling about the art and photo space. The year before I had developed [Pictwo](http://pictwoapp.com) with a designer and really enjoyed the feedback and community in that space. You could say I developed an addiction for making apps in the mobile artistic space. It just felt right to continue where I started with Pictwo. I kicked off a project codenamed Chemical with the purpose of allowing people to remix photo editing formulas created by members of the app community.

Nobody understood the idea of "remixing" photos. This was mostly due to my inability to pitch an idea and get others to see what is in my head. Surprisingly the original idea I had is still very much alive in Moxie. So the first thing I needed to learn as an entrepreneur was how to communicate my idea. This was done through practice and by talking to many people about my idea. It took time but I was able to grow in this area and bring on two great cofounders to make the perfect mix of hustler, hacker, and designer. We were off to the races.

For a while we got lost in the idea of applying to accelerators such as 500 startups and TechStars. We did about 8 applications and it turned out to be a very time consuming process. Of course looking back at this whole experience it was completely obvious that we were doing things out of order. First we needed to prove the business model by achieving traction _before_ we applied to any accelerator programs. I was constantly annoyed by the questions regarding traction and early sales. Couldn't they just tell what I already knew, the idea was solid and I only had to build it. Looking back at the applications and videos we made is embarrassing. At the same time I realize how much I've matured as an entrepreneur, I've become a little more wise about what it takes to create and prove a business model. The process of putting together applications was also a lesson in thinking our whole business model through. This lesson would be repeated many times over the coming months.

After the sidetrack of accelerator applications we decided it was time to get some work done. Development started and I did what I always do, which is severely underestimate the time needed to develop the product. I set a timeline of two months and then proceeded to break it down into sprints. Development is where I’m most comfortable and SCRUM is my management style of choice. Things started out very well and we were cruising. We even started an early beta to take a Lean Startup approach to development. We were crushing it!

Things went well those first 2 months and optimism was high. The next blog post will highlight the slow slide towards stalling and why we are stuck where we are now.
