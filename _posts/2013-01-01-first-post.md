Cargo Cult is a term that originates around WWII. Check out [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) for more info about the history, its an interesting read. Basically its the belief that following some practice without understanding its purpose will make you successful. We see this repeated again and again in tech, so many copy cats trying to gain success without the long hours of work it takes to get there. For developers this is known as [Cargo cult programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming). I've noticed this specifically among Java and enterprise developers. Its become my goal to try to fight this tendency in myself and others.

Merlin Mann can tell it better in this podcast...
